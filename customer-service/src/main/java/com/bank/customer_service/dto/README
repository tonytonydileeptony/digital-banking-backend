1️⃣ CustomerRequestDTO
❓ Why we added it

We never accept Entity objects directly from API requests.

🚨 Problem if not used

Exposes DB structure to clients

Security risk

Tight coupling

Hard to change DB later

✅ What this class does

Represents input data from client

Holds only required fields

Performs validation

📌 Example
@NotBlank
@Email
private String email;


✔ Prevents invalid data from entering system
✔ Automatically validated by Spring

🗣 Interview Answer

DTO separates API contract from database model and enables validation.

2️⃣ CustomerResponseDTO
❓ Why we added it

We control what data goes back to client.

🚨 Problem if not used

Client sees internal fields

Hard to hide sensitive info

Poor API design

✅ What it does

Sends clean response

Avoids exposing unnecessary fields

Helps versioning later

🗣 Interview Answer

Response DTO ensures controlled and stable API responses.

6️⃣ DTO Mapping for Lists
❓ Why?

Entities should NOT go to client.

✅ What we do

Convert entity list → DTO list

Prevent leakage of DB model

🗣 Interview Answer

DTO mapping ensures clean separation between persistence and API layers.
